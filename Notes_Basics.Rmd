# Installing and Setting up RStudio

The R console looks like this:

# File Organization

Make sure that you set up a folder for this class. It is important that you know it's file path. 

Download the Notes_Basics.Rmd file to your computer and add it to your class folder. 


# Using RMarkdown/knitr

You can *knit* the file. The first time you do this you will need to make sure you have the `knitr` package installed.

## RMarkdown formatting 

To make something "code-looking" we use the grave accent ` found in the upper left of your keyboard. 

To create a header, place a hash tag at the start of the line. For example, `# Header 1` or create a level 2 header using `# Header Level 2`. 

To make text italics put asterisk around the text `*like this*`. To make text bold, put two asterisks around the text `**like this**`. 

To make a list, just start creating your list using a `-` or `*` for each bullet, like this: 

```{r eval=F}
- list item 1
- list item 2
```

It is important that there is a blank line before the first bullet.  

Add a link: 
```{r eval=F}
[Alt text that will display](www.google.com)
```

[Alt text that will display](www.google.com)

Add an image: 

```{r eval=F}
![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/rmarkdown_wizards.png)
```

The vast majority of markdown syntax are available in the [RStudio RMarkdown Cheatsheet, Section 3](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf). 

## Chunk Options 

Create an R chunk: 

```{r}
2+3
```

OR

```{r}
x<-4
``` 

`echo=T` or `echo=F`-- determines whether or not to echo the source code in the output file. This can be useful if you are creating a document for someone to read that doesn't need to see or doesn't want to see you code, just the output. In general in this course for assignments I would like your code to be echoed. The default is `echo=F`. 

`results=T` or `results=F` -- determines whether or not the results will be displayed. This can be useful if you want to show code, but don't care what the output is. The default is `eval=T`.

`eval=T` or `eval=F` -- determines whether or not to evaluate the code. This can be useful if you have a whole chunk of code you don't want run, but you also don't want to. The default is `eval=T`.

There are many, many more options including `fig.width`, `fig.height`, `cache`, etc. The vast majority of options are available in the [RStudio RMarkdown Cheatsheet, Section 5](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf). 

You have the option to set the options individually on each chunk and/or set the global options by using the code `knitr::opts_chunk$set(your options here))` in the first code chunk. 

## Inline Code

Rather than using a code chunk (which is centered in the middle of the page), you also have to options to use inline code. You can place the following within any sentence or paragraph. 

```{r eval=F}
`r codehere`
```

For example, 

```{r eval=F}
This is the number `r x`.
```

becomes... This is the number `r x`.

## Knitting into .html, .doc, or .pdf

# Installing Packages

Packages can contain lots of things including: data sets, functions, etc.

You can install packages using the packages tab or you can use the code `install.packages('packageyouwant')` in the console. 

In each new R session where you want to use the package you will have to load it by typing `library('packageyouwant')` in the console (or in the RMarkdown document - more later).

# Importing  Data

From a file on your computer: 

From the web: 

For now, we will mostly be working with `.csv` and `.xls` files. Later in the course, we may discuss other types of files.

# Best Practices 

## Commenting

- Be sure to comment your code (in R, use a `#` before a line of comment)
- The more descriptive you can be the easier it will be for other to read (and for you to read later)

## Naming

When naming variables, observations, data frames, or files, make them: 

- meaningful 
- consistent
- concise 
- code and coder friendly 

Other naming considerations: 

- avoid names that are common/used function names (ie. `filter` or `mean`)
- consider making object names nouns, and function names verbs
- it's not the end of the world if you give something a bad name, but it will save you (and others) time and effort down the road
- avoid formatting and symbols (ie. spaces or \&)
- keep a clear record of your variable names as well as longer descriptions including units (ie. `surface_temp`= surface temperature measurement on Mars in degrees Celsius)

## Entering Things 

Some suggestions for best practices: 

- be consistent (ie. `purple` vs. `Purple` vs. `purple_`)
- put any additional information such as units or notes in a column separate from the value
- if there is missing entries, enter the name thing for each missing value (it is common to use `NA`, `NaN`, `-9999`, `-`); don't leave cells blank
- if data is abbreviated, make a record somewhere of how the what they mean
